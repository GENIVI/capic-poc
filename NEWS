capic 0.1.0
-----------

* This is the first public release of Common API C.  The project is in
  the early stages and does not yet provide much of consumable
  functionality.  The current goal is to flesh out the big picture of
  how the functionality should be split and what are the required
  interfaces.

* Reference examples including 'simple', 'game' and 'smartie' are
  provided to drive the development and to illustrate the usage.

* Supported Franca features include:

  - synchronous and asynchronous method invocation (including
    fireAndForget);

  - primitive data types of fixed size (i.e., Boolean, IntNN, UIntNN,
    Float, and Double).

* Supported backends include only D-Bus (via libsystemd's sd-bus).

* Both client and server applications are capable of managing multiple
  interface instances.  Additionally, server applications can provide
  different implementation for instances of a particular interface.
  Working with multiple instances and their implementations is
  illustrated by the 'simple' reference example.

* Backends use an event loop to manage asynchronicity.  Backends
  provide an interface to embed their event loop into the
  application's event loop.  Event loop embedding is illustrated by
  the 'game' reference example.
